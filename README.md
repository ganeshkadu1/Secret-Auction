# Secret-Auction
A silent auction is an event at which items for sale are displayed for attendees to assess, place bids on, and purchase. However, unlike most auctions, there is no auctioneer present, and participants place their bids silently and anonymously on a bid sheet using a bidding number—hence the name silent auction.
